we wild and bad and bang the lawed nation
your crying like a baby like a bank gotcha ration
we owning the city no more congratulation
she twisting whirling like she gone done gyration
we just motherfucking cubans and we hang raw da Haitain
veteran with gun when you slang yeah ma station
now what are you calling me now wrong na na stray son
and what I do with my knife is called lung demonstation
I've got a wife got a bitch and I can get a maiden
